## Definition of Crime

Crime can be defined as an act or the commission of an act that is forbidden or punishable by law. It typically involves behavior that violates societal norms and is subject to legal sanctions. Crimes can be categorized into various types, including felonies (serious offenses) and misdemeanors (less serious offenses). The specific definition of crime can vary between jurisdictions, but it generally encompasses:

- **Conduct that is prohibited**: Actions that society has deemed unacceptable.
- **Punishment**: Legal consequences imposed on individuals who commit these acts.
- **Social harm**: The impact of the act on individuals or society at large.

## Difference Between Morality, Crime, and Criminal Law

| **Definition**        | A system of beliefs about what is right and wrong, often influenced by culture and religion. | Acts that violate legal statutes and are punishable by law. | The body of law that defines crimes and prescribes punishments. |
| **Basis**             | Based on ethical principles and societal norms. | Based on legal statutes and regulations.    | Established through legislative processes.     |
| **Enforcement**       | Enforced through social norms and personal conscience. | Enforced by the state through law enforcement agencies. | Enforced by the judicial system and law enforcement. |
| **Consequences**      | May involve social stigma or disapproval.    | Involves legal penalties such as fines or imprisonment. | Specifies legal penalties for violations.      |

In summary, while morality pertains to personal beliefs about right and wrong, crime refers to actions that break the law, and criminal law is the framework that defines these crimes and their consequences.
