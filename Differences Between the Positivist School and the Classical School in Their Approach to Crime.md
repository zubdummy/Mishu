## 1) Differences Between the Positivist School and the Classical School in Their Approach to Crime

The **positivist school** and the **classical school** of criminology present fundamentally different approaches to understanding crime.

****Classical School****:

- **Free Will**: The classical school, which emerged in the 18th century, is based on the idea of free will. It posits that individuals choose to commit crimes after weighing the potential benefits against the consequences. 

- **Deterrence**: This school emphasizes deterrence through punishment, advocating that the severity of punishment should be proportionate to the crime to discourage future offenses.

- **Legal Definition of Crime**: Crimes are defined strictly by legal statutes, focusing on the act itself rather than the individual committing it.

- **Equality in Punishment**: The classical approach promotes equal punishment for all individuals committing the same offense, regardless of personal circumstances.

****Positivist School****:

- **Determinism**: In contrast, the positivist school, which arose in the 19th century, rejects the notion of free will. It argues that criminal behavior is determined by various factors beyond an individual's control, including biological, psychological, and sociological influences.

- **Focus on Treatment**: Instead of advocating for punitive measures, positivists emphasize rehabilitation and treatment tailored to the individual offender's circumstances and needs.

- **Sociological Definition of Crime**: This school favors a broader definition of crime that considers social context and individual characteristics rather than solely legal definitions.

- **Variability in Punishment**: Positivists argue that punishment should vary based on the offender's specific situation and motivations rather than being uniformly applied.

In summary, while the classical school views crime as a rational choice made by free individuals, the positivist school sees it as a result of determinative factors that necessitate a more individualized approach to justice.

## 2) Explanation of Beccaria's Statement

Cesare Beccaria's assertion that "It is not the severity of punishment that deters; it is the certainty of punishment" highlights a crucial principle in criminology regarding how effective deterrence works.

- **Certainty Over Severity**: Beccaria argued that individuals are more likely to be deterred from committing crimes if they believe there is a high likelihood of being caught and punished rather than if they fear harsh penalties. The idea is that if people perceive a strong chance of facing consequences for their actions, they will think twice before engaging in criminal behavior.

- **Rational Calculation**: This perspective aligns with classical theories of criminology, which suggest that individuals make rational choices based on potential risks and rewards. If the certainty of punishment is low—regardless of how severe it may be—individuals may feel emboldened to commit crimes.

- **Practical Implications**: Beccaria's statement implies that criminal justice systems should focus on increasing the likelihood of apprehension and conviction rather than solely emphasizing harsher penalties. Effective policing, clear laws, and swift justice can enhance deterrence more effectively than merely increasing sentences for offenses.

In essence, Beccaria’s statement underscores the importance of reliable enforcement in preventing crime, suggesting that a well-functioning justice system can deter criminal behavior more effectively than merely threatening severe punishments.
